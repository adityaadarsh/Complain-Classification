# Complain-Classification
 
### Business Problem:

1. This is an NLP-based problem solving approach for the dataset available as a consumer-complaint database for the Banking sector. It contains 1,179,715 rows and 18 columns. The dataset contains 300k+ rows of complaints texts.

2. We need to classify consumer complaints text into these categories: Debt collection, Consumer Loan, Mortgage, Credit card, Credit reporting, Student loan, Bank account or service, Payday loan, Money transfers, other financial service, prepaid card.

3. This kind of model will be very useful for a customer service department that wants to classify the complaints they receive from their customers. The classification of the issues they have received into buckets will help the department to provide customized solutions to the customers in each group.

4. This model can also be expanded into a system that can recommend automatic solutions to future complaints as they come in.

5. In the past, performing these kinds of tasks were done manually by multiple employees and of course, take a long time to accomplish, delaying swift response to the complaints received.
 
6. Machine learning and AI are here to solve this caliber of problems. Imagine you can classify new complaints with 95% accuracy and route them to the right team to resolve the issue. That will be a win and time saving to any business.

 7. Your customers will be happy because the right expert from your business will talk to your customers in trying to resolving their complaints. This will translate into lowering churning rate which means more revenue.
